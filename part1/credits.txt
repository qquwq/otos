KNOWN BUGS:
- I'm not responsible for what happens if you refresh in the middle of the page
- Opening up the "Inspect Element" / Console for browsers will cause animation errors to trigger wrongly when closed if it is situated on the bottom of the browser.
- If you scroll through Chongyun's exorcism moment really fast, Chongyun's SVG symbol gets stuck in the background. Scroll back into the area and scroll back out slowly.
