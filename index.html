      <h3>Summary:</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>In retrospect, it probably starts on that moonless summer night, when Xingqiu&rsquo;s nighttime jaunt brings him under the shadow of a red mountain. Under the shadow of this red mountain, he feels a strange meaning on the wind that stirs him to lift his head, and at that moment, his gaze falls upon the fleeting figure of a yaksha flying through the clouds.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Liyue legends say it is fortune to gaze upon an adeptus in one&rsquo;s lifetime, but Xingqiu is rather inured to the sight after seeing Adeptus Xiao at Hu Tao&rsquo;s funeral parlor every other week. Still, that faint silhouette glowing jade-like under the distant starlight stays with him for hours after, and even when he closes his eyes to sleep, he can still feel the chill of the mountain air sinking into his bones.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For a long time, though, Xingqiu is convinced it all starts when he wakes up one morning filled with the burning desire to perform a live reading of his novel in Liyue Harbor&rsquo;s most public square.&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Xingqiu would like to keep his secrets, remain uncursed, and have some fun with his best friend. Unfortunately, in life, things rarely go to plan...</p>

    <h2>About the art</h2>
    <p>The art was made using Clip Studio Paint and all features available in Clip Studio Paint Pro. Two custom brushes and the default fine flat oil brush were used.</p>
    <p>The text divider is an SVG drawn in CSP before being converted to an SVG file with <a href="https://www.photopea.com/">Photopea</a>, an entirely browser-based replacement for PhotoShop. Then it was converted into HTML using this <a href="https://anyconv.com/svg-to-html-converter/">SVG to HTML converter</a>. Artist's comment: Please consult your adblock before venturing onto these sites, I cannot guarantee what anything looks like without uBlock Origin...</p>
    <p>Chongyun's exorcism symbol was first made in <a href="https://vectr.com/">Vectr</a>, a free browser vector drawing software, before changing to use <a href="https://www.svgator.com/">SVGator.</a></p>
    <h2>About the writing</h2>
    <p>Author's comment: The idea for this story was almost entirely triggered by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKBSvzjsPzc">Xingqiu Yoiyoi Kokon MMD.</a> If you understand you understand. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEsofGhDShQ">Cynical Night Plan</a> Xingqiu MMD is also very good. Check them out, okay?</p>
    <h2>About the coding</h2>
    <p>This story has been created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tools used were as following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Animation:</strong> The <a href="https://greensock.com/">GSAP Library</a> and its ScrollTrigger plugin. The documentation is extensive and the community is very friendly. If you would like to create a similar project or learn more about browser animations, please check them out.</li>
      <li><strong>Wuwang Hill Firefly Animation:</strong> <a href="https://codepen.io/MinzCode/pen/dyGXBBX">MinzCode's Firefly Animation Tutorial</a> was used. Please check out his YouTube channel for great educational videos.</li>
      <li><strong>Text Editor:</strong> <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, a multi-purpose text editor. Programmer's comment: Highly recommended if you don't stick with any particular language, but for dedicated text editors for specific languages, try editors like PyCharm or IntelliJ. Good luck out there!</li>
      <li><strong>Educational Resources:</strong> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> has excellent documentation for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other languages.</li>
      <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Powered by <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Known Bugs</h2>

      <li>Scrolling through the webpage extremely quickly may cause different HTML elements' exit animations to trigger incorrectly or not trigger at all. Please be kind to the webpage. If you are trying to find a specific quote, resource, or picture, try consulting the transcripts for a faster and smoother loading time.</li>
